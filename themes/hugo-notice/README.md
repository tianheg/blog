## Usage

1. Add the `hugo-notice` as a submodule to be able to get upstream changes later `git submodule add https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice.git themes/hugo-notice`
2. Add `hugo-notice` as the left-most element of the `theme` list variable in your site's or theme's configuration file `config.yaml` or `config.toml`. Example, with `config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    theme: ["hugo-notice", "my-theme"]
    ```
    or, with `config.toml`,
    ```toml
    theme = ["hugo-notice", "my-theme"]
    ```
3. In your site, use the shortcode, this way:
    ```go
    {{< notice warning >}}
    This is a warning notice. Be warned!
    {{< /notice >}}
    ```
    or
    ```go
    {{< notice tip >}}
    This is a very good tip.
    {{< /notice >}}
    ```
