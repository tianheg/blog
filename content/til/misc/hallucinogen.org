* Hallucinogen

Psilocybin mushrooms and their active ingredient, psilocybin, are hallucinogens classified as controlled substances and illegal drugs. In most countries, possession, sale, and production of these substances are criminal offenses.  

After consuming magic mushrooms, the effects typically last for about six hours. If the experience is a "good trip," users may undergo mystical experiences, which could include:  
- A sense of oneness with the universe  
- Transcendence of time and space  
- Gaining wisdom through intuition  
- Feelings of sacredness or divinity  
- Deeply positive emotions  
- Confronting ineffable, profound experiences  

Users might describe such an experience as spiritual, mystical, or a "peak experience."  

However, if it is a "bad trip," some individuals may experience terrifying hallucinations and, driven by fear, engage in self-harm or violent behavior toward others.

食用神奇蘑菇后，会有6个小时左右的药效期。如果是个“好的旅程”，使用者会产生神秘体验，可能包括：与宇宙合一，超越时空，透过直觉获得智慧，产生神圣感，深入积极情绪，直面不可言说的体验。使用者可能会称这个经历为灵性的，神秘的，高峰体验。如果是个坏的旅程，也有些人会出现可怕的幻觉，并因恐惧而做出伤害自己或攻击他人的行为。
