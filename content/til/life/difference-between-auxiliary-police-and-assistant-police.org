Auxiliary police and assistant police are both auxiliary personnel working in public security organs, but they have some differences in terms of establishment, responsibilities, recruitment conditions, and treatment.

Differences in Establishment:

Auxiliary Police: They are employed under the civil service establishment and are considered formal auxiliary police personnel.

Assistant Police: They are usually temporary personnel, outside of the establishment, and not part of the formal establishment.

Differences in Responsibilities and Powers:

Auxiliary Police: They have certain administrative law enforcement powers and can assist in various police activities under the guidance of regular police, such as security patrols, responding to incidents, preventing illegal activities, and directing traffic.

Assistant Police: They do not have independent law enforcement powers and mainly assist in specific tasks under the guidance of police officers, such as traffic control and maintaining order at the scene.

Recruitment Conditions:

Auxiliary Police: The recruitment process is more stringent, involving multiple stages like application, written tests, interviews, physical fitness tests, medical examinations, and political reviews.

Assistant Police: Recruitment conditions are relatively relaxed, with some positions only requiring passing physical fitness tests and medical examinations, making the process simpler.

Salary and Benefits:

Auxiliary Police: Due to being part of the civil service establishment, they receive relatively good salaries and comprehensive benefits.

Assistant Police: As temporary workers, their salary and benefits are usually lower than those of auxiliary police and may not be as comprehensive.

Positioning and Nature:

Auxiliary Police: They play a more important auxiliary role within public security organs and participate in more police activities.

Assistant Police: They are typically positioned as auxiliary police forces, belonging to specialized teams for community policing and crime prevention, mainly assisting in departments like traffic police units.

In summary, auxiliary police and assistant police differ in terms of job nature, scope of responsibilities, recruitment processes, and treatment, but both are indispensable and important forces within the public security system, playing crucial roles in maintaining social order and traffic management.
