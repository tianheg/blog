When looking at the computer screen, the appearance of horizontal stripes in the eyes is a phenomenon commonly referred to as visual fatigue or interference, and may be caused by several reasons:

Visual fatigue: Prolonged focus on the computer screen can lead to eye fatigue, reducing the eyes' regulatory ability, which may result in visual blur or the appearance of stripes.

Screen refresh rate issues: If the computer screen's refresh rate is not set properly or the screen itself has a low refresh rate, it may visually produce stripes or a flickering sensation.

Monitor quality issues: Some monitors may have quality issues, such as pixel arrangement problems in LCD screens or uneven backlighting, which could cause stripes to appear when viewed from specific angles.

Ocular physiological issues: Conditions like dry eye, astigmatism, or other eye diseases may lead to visual interference when looking at the screen.

Electromagnetic interference: High-frequency electromagnetic fields near the computer screen may affect vision; although this typically does not directly cause eye stripes, it may exacerbate visual issues in some cases.

Distance and angle between the eyes and the screen: Incorrect viewing distance or angle can lead to visual stripes or discomfort.

Environmental lighting: Strong or reflected light can cause screen glare, which may visually produce a striped effect.

Medication side effects: Certain medications, such as antihistamines or antidepressants, may affect visual perception, leading to the appearance of stripes or other visual abnormalities.

If this situation occurs, here are some possible mitigations:

Adjust the screen brightness and contrast to ensure comfortable viewing.

Use anti-blue light glasses or screen protectors to reduce eye fatigue.

Increase the screen's refresh rate if possible.

Maintain an appropriate viewing distance and angle.

Take regular breaks, especially after prolonged computer use, and practice eye relaxation exercises.

If the problem persists, it is recommended to consult an ophthalmologist for a professional examination.

It is important to note that if the appearance of stripes in the eyes is accompanied by headaches, decreased vision, or other visual issues, medical attention should be sought promptly.
