Contrary to popular opinion, people with higher education level and cognitive ability are not more tolerant

真正决定一个人是否宽容，是下面三个因素。 The three factors that truly determine whether a person is tolerant are as follows.

- 思维灵活 Flexible thinking
- 个性不固执 Not stubborn
- 专注

这就是说，如果某人容易接受新观点（思维灵活），不固执已见，也不容易分心（专注），他很可能是一个宽容的人。 This means that if someone is open to new ideas (mentally flexible), not stubborn, and not easily distracted (focused), they are likely to be a tolerant person.
