:END:
Yellow or amber-tinted lenses are known to be effective in filtering out blue light to a significant extent. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and higher energy compared to other visible light, and yellow or amber lenses can help block a portion of this blue light. These lenses can be particularly useful for reducing eye strain and improving visual comfort, especially when using digital devices for extended periods.

Sun-glasses can be used.
