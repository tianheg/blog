Notes:

You have to be aware that each file is saved exactly once. Should a file be damaged by a disk failure, for example, this file will be corrupted in all following backups. Therefore, it is best practice to store very important data in more than one repository!

important data need backup many places(two remote one local)

Storage service providers(1TB = 1000GB):

- [[https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box][Hetzner storage box]] $48/TB/year
