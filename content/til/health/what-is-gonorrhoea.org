- Gonorrhoea is a preventable and curable sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is primarily transmitted through vaginal, oral and anal sex.
- In 2020 there were an estimated 82.4 million new infections among adults globally.
- Most women with gonorrhoea do not have symptoms, and when they do, vaginal discharge is common, while most men present with discharge from their penis.
- If left untreated, gonorrhoea can lead to infertility in both men and women and other sexual and reproductive health complications. It also increases the risk of HIV infection.
- Antimicrobial resistance to gonorrhoea is a serious and growing problem, rendering many classes of antibiotics as ineffective with the risk of becoming untreatable.
