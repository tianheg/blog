* Git stash

=git stash= is Git's “clipboard” for uncommitted work.

What it actually does:
1. Takes every *tracked* file that is modified (staged or unstaged) and saves the changes away in a special area (the “stash”).
2. Reverts those files back to the state of the last commit, so your working tree and index look clean again.
3. Leaves *untracked* files and *ignored* files alone unless you add options (=-u=, =-a=).

The result: you can switch branches, pull, merge, etc. without committing half-done work.

Later you can bring the changes back with =git stash pop= (apply + drop) or =git stash apply= (keep a copy in the stash).

Quick recipe:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# save current dirty state
git stash push -m "WIP on login feature"

# …do something else…

# restore it
git stash pop
#+END_SRC

Think of it as “pause & bookmark” for your uncommitted edits.
