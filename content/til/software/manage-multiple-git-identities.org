global config file, ~/.gitconfig

#+begin_src conf
[user]
    name = Garrit Franke
    email = garrit@slashdev.space
[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work
[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/client2/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-client2
[includeIf "gitdir:~/sources/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
#+end_src

If the repository is located inside the ~/work directory, a file named ~/.gitconfig-work is included. This is just another gitconfig file. This is what that looks like in my case:

#+begin_src conf
[user]
    name = Garrit Franke
    signingkey = 12345678
    email = garrit@work.de
[commit]
    gpgsign = true
#+end_src
