ZBLM: Zero Blue Light Mode

https://www.ycproject.cn/ycpview/ycp-zblm/ycp-zblm.html

The Zero Blue Light Mode (ZBLM) is a color scheme primarily used for software interface themes (or app interface themes, or UI themes) and is a screen eye protection solution designed by the Yichuang project. The main feature of this solution is the complete removal of blue light to help users alleviate eye fatigue and achieve better eye protection. The Zero Blue Light Mode can be applied to current devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets with color screens.
