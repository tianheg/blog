Google Earth Studio is a browser-based animation tool for Google Earth's 3D and satellite imagery.

Google Earth has a massive store of 2D and 3D Earth data, from large-scale geological features to individual city buildings. Earth Studio is the easiest way to leverage this imagery for still and animated content.
