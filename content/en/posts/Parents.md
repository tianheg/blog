I had a quarrel with my father today. I can't do what he ask and I'm ashamed. I'm unable to make money because I don't know what can I do. I want to make money through programing, but I'm not good at it now. 

Every time I find myself worthless, I sink into deep despair. I'm not an absolute optimist.

I'm begin to read books. That's a good start, isn't it?

Hope you have a great day.
