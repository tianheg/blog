> *Reading those English documents is very difficult.*

When studying programing, I had known that English can't be my weakness. I would like to read these English books.

Not only I can study many technical skills, but also I can learn about other people in the earth.

I've figure out the reason for my dizziness. I always stay up late recently so my body was overwhelmed. I went to bed early the day before yesterday and didn't feel dizzy yesterday. I stayed up last night and feel dizzy again today.

So, I tell you from my own experience: don't stay up late.
