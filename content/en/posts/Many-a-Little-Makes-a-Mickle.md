Many a little makes a mickle

I'm very glad that you read my diary.There are too many errors that I can't correct all of them, and I am supposed that I should write it as much as possible. 

Only after I always use it, can I find problems and correct them. There are too many Chinese English, so I'm sure you'll understand my meaning.

Today I'm still giddily and I don't what happened about my body. Even though I've been basking in the sun this morning.Hope I'll be better tomorrow.

Error:

giddily --> giddy   中式英语：Chinglish

adv.    --> adj.
