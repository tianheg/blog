Grocery shopping: eggs, potatos, mushroom, lasagna, shallot

If ideas can't be record fastly, I'll forget it.

The sun:sunny: in the morning is nice

It's not so bad to go through things with money

Is life full of tension like stretching?

I forgot taking my ID card

Only when you really feel it can you feel it

Consider it in the whole, and do it in the part

Completing the most important thing every day(for the future)
