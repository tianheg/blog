I fight with my mother in the morning. She always help me, I have grown up and don't need her help. I feel bored about it. I don't want her upset my plan.

Now I can't handle too much time, so it's important to read books as many as possilbe. But it's easy to read books which understand easily, so I must read books not so easy.
