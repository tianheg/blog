Today, my mom take young sister's mobile phone away. In the first time, I think about my sister can't look outside world anyway, so I'm angry about mother's motivation. I thought she can't understand sister's need. What is my sister's most need? I think it's respect, but I think it's not the correctest answer. I try my bast to help my sister go away her educational environment, but I'm concerned about my influence with her growth. I'm not god, I just her brother, I don't know how to deal with it.

I want to read The Pragmatic Programmer2.

Today, dad and mom help me return money from my classmates.
