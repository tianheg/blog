I wanna go to Austin but I want to stay home

想去奥斯汀又不愿离开家

Invite our friends all but still be alone

享受一群人在一起的孤独

Live for danger play it cool

镇定的在未知的生活游戏中盘旋

Have everyone respect me for being the fool

所有人都笑说我是傻呵呵的智者

I wanna have 15 ice creams

我想要15支冰激凌

But still watch what I eat

也会那么不贪婪的放下一半已进入胃中的食物

And win all the prizes

赢得荣誉

But still keep my feet

依旧脚踏实地的前进

I want for us to be together forever

我希望我们永远在一起

But to wander wherever I may

但徜徉在任何我想去的地方

I want you to be easy and casual

我想让你放松随意

But still demand I stay

但仍要求我留下

I want for us to go out to dinner

我想和你一起吃晚饭

And make a home cooked meal

一起下厨

Wear an evening gown

穿上晚礼服

And quickly ditch the heels

踹掉累死人的高跟鞋

Climb to the top look over the ledge

登上山顶， 凭崖远眺

Dance bare foot on a razor's edge

赤脚在刀刃上跳舞

Reach for the stars grab the tiger by the tail

伸手去够星星，抓住老虎的尾巴

But if I don't try I'll never fail

如果不去尝试，永远不会失败

'Cause if you go home you're rolling dice

如果回家，你将孤注一掷

Can't step in the same river twice

无法两次踏入同一条河流

You love too much it'll turn to hate

爱多及恨

If you never leave home you'll never be late

永远不回家，就永远不会晚

everything's like your grandma said

一切都像外婆预测的那样

You can't make gold from a pot of lead

铅罐里长不出黄金

Jesse James was just a crook

侠盗不过是智商高的骗子

You can't learn to plow by reading a book

知识并不是力量

I wanna take the train but get there fast

我想开着跑车

Live in the moment have everything last

享受每个开心的时光

Achieve great things but not really care

去实现那些理想但并不为之烦恼

Have everyone love me but tell 'em not to stare

享受所有人的爱并不骄纵

I wanna be really rich

我想要变得富有

But not care about money

但这与金钱无关

To always tell the truth

我想要一直说实话

But still be really funny

但依旧是个有趣的人

I want for you to know me completely

我想让你完全了解我

But still remain mysterious

但仍然保持神秘

Consider everything deeply

深入思量一切

But still remain fearless

但仍然毫无畏惧

I'm easy to please

我很容易开心呀

I like chocolate and vanilla

我喜欢巧克力味和香草味儿的

Ask me to choose and I'll pick saspirilla

如果一定要选那就选这个吧

I like sunsets but I love sunrises

我爱日出也爱日落

And I don't care about the color of your eyes

不管你的眼眸颜色

Gotta play fast but only shoot once

人生来一次轻狂又怎样呢

Stand in the corner hold hands with the dance

在角落里握着自己的手起舞

Only things for certain nothing stays the same

没有两片相同的叶子

And each and every kid only gets one name

每个孩童都是独特的

Eat too much you're gonna get fat

吃得太多就会发胖

Buy a dog and you'll piss off the cat

买只狗就会惹毛你的猫

So take a deep breath and enjoy the ride

那么深呼吸，享受这过程

'Cause arrivals and departures run side by side

因为有聚就会有散
