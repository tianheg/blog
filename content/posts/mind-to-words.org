#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I've written about at least two subjects I know well --- Lisp hacking
  and startups --- and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about
  them. In both cases there were things I didn't consciously realize
  till I had to explain them.
#+END_QUOTE

直到需要解释的时候，才明白理解得并不清楚。能够从写作过程中获得新的理解。
