#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  As a commander in the Imperial Japanese Navy, it was my duty to kill
  you. But as a man, I have regrets.

  I had a good idea of what we were carrying. I, too, did my duty. But
  as a man, I find no honour in it.

  We have learned to forgive each other as former adversaries. Perhaps
  one day, we can forgive ourselves as men.
