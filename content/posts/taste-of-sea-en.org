It was around noon. I had just gotten off the bus and was looking for a place to eat. Walking along the road, I saw the Dark Sky Planetarium. At the intersection behind it, I saw some people eating. I asked if I could buy food from them. They said yes. The owner handed me a menu; everything was around 30 or 40 yuan. I asked if they had anything else. He said they had noodles. I asked what came with the noodles. He replied that there were vegetables and meat. I asked how much it cost. He said 25 yuan. Okay, I'll take that. When the noodles were served, I was surprised to find they were served in a large bowl, with noodles, meat, and vegetables. I was very satisfied and ate with great enjoyment.

After eating, I checked the navigation and decided to go to the beach. I asked for directions and walked along the road for a while, only to find that I had to buy a ticket, which cost 35 yuan. I went to Xichong No. 2 Beach. When I went, there were almost no people there because it was midday, and the sun was high overhead, but it wasn't hot.

I went to Xichong No. 2 Beach. When I went, there were almost no people there because it was midday, and the sun was high overhead, but it wasn't hot.

After splashing around in the water a few times, my pants got wet, and so did the papers I'd brought—the ones I used to jot down notes. So I stopped playing. I wanted to walk along the line where the shore met the sea until I saw the observatory. So I went back to where I'd taken off my shoes, and put my socks inside them so they wouldn't fall out while I walked. And so, I walked, observing the sea and the people on the shore. The water was constantly churning, and sometimes I felt dizzy from the sloshing, so I'd rest in a spot where the water wouldn't get in, and then continue walking.

During my walk, I found several beautiful seashells. Their surfaces, smoothed by the long wash of the sea, were irresistible to me. Moreover, the even color of these smooth shells created a sense of harmony. This is another reason why I love them. Seeing these seashells reminded me of Newton's famous quote: "I do not know what I am in the eyes of others, but to my own eyes I have only seen myself as a boy playing on the seashore, occasionally pleased with the discovery of a smoother shell or a prettier one, while remaining completely oblivious to the vast ocean of truth that lay before me." I also saw mushroom-shaped transparent objects; I didn't know what they were, but I guessed they might be jellyfish.

And so I walked and walked. From beach number 2 to number 3, and from number 3 to number 4. I put on socks and shoes without washing my feet because I couldn't find a place to wash them. Then, I decided to go to the observatory. So I chose a path, but unexpectedly, it wasn't easy to walk on.

I walked the Kunpeng Path, and halfway through, I saw a silver pole with the words "Kunpeng Path" written on it. This path leads from the beach to the boardwalk at the observatory. I walked carefully, tense my body, step by step, afraid of stepping on a loose rock and twisting my ankle, or falling and scraping myself. Fortunately, I wasn't injured. When I reached the boardwalk, I was dizzy and needed to rest for a while to recover. The view of the mountains and sea merging in the distance from there was breathtaking. The blue-green sea was so beautiful, I could never get enough of it.

I started walking on the boardwalk, resting for a while after each step, and looking at the distant sea view, I felt that my trip hadn't been in vain.
