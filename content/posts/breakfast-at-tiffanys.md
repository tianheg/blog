不知道自己是谁

Paul: You know what's wrong with you, Miss Whoever-you-are?

You're chicken. You've got no guts.

You're afraid to stick out your chin and say, "Okay, life's a fact."

People do fail in love and people do belong to each other.

Because that's the only chance anybody's got for real happiness.

You call yourself a free spirit, a wild thing...

and you're terrified somebody will stick you in a cage.

Well, baby, you're already in that cage,

you built it yourself.

It's wherever you go.

**Because no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.**

无论去哪里，都要面对自己。
