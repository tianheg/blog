I want to deploy [[https://forgejo.org/][Forgejo]] for about two years, never want to write a post about it. Now I finally deploy it. Why I want to self-host this GitHub alternative? Because I hate complexity, I donot like GitHub which has more 'features' but users donot benefit from them. I want something certain, I'm sure I own the data when I have a Forgejo instance. If I host my code on GitHub, I have to deal with the terible UX. I couldn't stand with it anymore.

Now let me show the way how I deploy Forgejo.

* Forgejo self-host

Use a Hetzner server deploy Forgejo.

Install PG not config it, config it through Forgejo initial web page.

Config DB: https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/database-preparation/#postgresql

Use Caddy as reverse proxy https://idroot.us/install-caddy-ubuntu-24-04/#Step_1_Install_Caddy_on_Ubuntu_2404

Steps:

** 1. Ubuntu initial setup

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
apt autoremove snapd --purge -y
#+END_SRC
