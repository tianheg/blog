Back in early November, I was reading up on health stuff, dental health included. The advice was to get your teeth cleaned regularly—it gets rid of tartar and plaque, preventing all sorts of oral problems.

Didn’t do much research for the clinic. Just did a quick search on WeChat and Amap and found Tongbu Dental. Booked an appointment for today two weeks ago at their Xixiang branch. Took almost 50 minutes to get there from my place. So yeah, based on that alone, won’t be going back there next time.

They put this mask over your face, everything but your mouth, because that operating light is insanely bright and uncomfortable otherwise. Didn’t hurt much during the cleaning, just a bit of sensitivity in one spot. But I was pretty on edge the whole time, scared I’d suddenly get a shooting pain. Thankfully, that never happened.

The Meituan group deal was only 68 yuan—felt almost too cheap. I’ve asked around, and my colleagues have paid two or three hundred. I’ll try somewhere else next time, test out different chains and see what the difference is.
