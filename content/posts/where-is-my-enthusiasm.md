Where is my enthusiasm?

The feelings about writing, reading.

They just gone.

I've heard of others having this passion, but not me.

Maybe I had it once, then I lost it.

Why did I lose? How do I get back?

Other can make progress, better than yesterday; but I think I'm worse than yesterday.

Why can't I feel the energetic self of the future? Why can't?

The fucking society, so annoying, so boring. I feel bad.

Everybody but me try to teach me, guide me（每个人都想给别人当爹）. Nobody care about my feelings.

What's wrong with the society? What's wrong with the people?

Pressure inside my body is driving me crazy.
