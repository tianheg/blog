/Rick and Morty/ 第五季第三集片尾曲

Who are you? Who am I to you?

I am the antichrist to you

Fallen from the sky with grace

Into your arms race

-----

Lucid lovers me and you

A deal of matchless value

I was always quick to admit defeat

Empty statements of bones and meat

-----

And my heart, it shook with fear

I′m a coward behind a shield and spear

Take this sword and throw it far

Let it shine under the morning star

-----

Who are you? Who am I to you?

I am the antichrist to you

Fallen from the sky with grace

Into your arms race

-----

One for my heart and two for show

Three tears for all the souls below

One day we turned them into figurinees

Burned them all with all my favorite things

-----

Who are you? Who am I to you?

I am the antichrist to you

Fallen from the sky with grace

Into your arms race

-----

Who are you? Who am I to you?

I am the antichrist to you

Fallen from the sky with grace

Into your arms

Into your arms

Into your arms
