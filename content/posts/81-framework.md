1、赚钱：确保你有一份工作，或者一份咨询工作，或者能带来直接回报的事情。

Box 1: Transact

The first box in the 8 + 1 system is Transact, and it's about making
money.

Transact is just making sure that you have a job, or advisory gigs, or
something that's bringing in a direct revenue stream to support your
life.

2、投资，做那些能随着时间产生复利效应的事情。

Box 2: Invest

The second box is Invest, and it's really about doing things where my
input today compounds over time.

3、助益，帮助他人，同时在自己在某些事情上有所助益，并做得更好。

Box 3: Assist

The third box is Assist, and it's about helping people. It's something I
do anyway, but I want to become better at it. Having it as a bucket
makes sure that I'm purposeful about doing more assisting, and getting
better at it.

4、学习，知道自己输出的是什么，然后去学习那些能让自己精进的知识。

Box 4: Learn

The fourth box is Learn. This box is about being very self-aware of what
my output is, and then figuring out what I need to learn to become
better at providing that output.

5、健康，用电脑来打比喻的话，你的身体就是硬件，思维就是软件，无论是身体还是思维出了问题，那一些都免谈了。

Box 5: Health

The fifth box is Health.

To make a computer metaphor: your body is your hardware, and your mind
is your software. So if your body or your mind breaks down everything
else breaks down.

6、家庭，明确自己在家庭的中的角色定位，如父亲、丈夫等等，并按照相应的角色去处事。

Box 6: Family

The sixth box is Family. I have a wife and a kid, and I aspire to be a
good husband and a good father. Having this as an explicit box makes
sure that I'm being purposeful and conscious about achieving those
goals.

7、关系，让自己成为一个善于交际的人，定期花时间和你珍视的人建立联系。

Box 7: Relationships

The seventh box is Relationships.

And because of that I've been more of a social butterfly than most
people. And think that's helped me become better at what I do.

8、关注自我或者是自我关怀，做那些让自己开心的事，感恩的事，享受的事。

Box 8: Ego or Self-Kindness

The last box is Ego or Self-Kindness.

This box is about doing things for myself, and doing things that make me
happy, and grateful, and creating moments for myself that I enjoy.

注重自我关怀

+1，每周定期回顾检视，确保执行到位。

Plus One

The Plus One part of this is setting aside time every single week to go
through each of the boxes and make sure that they're filled up.
