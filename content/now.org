我明白了，最重要的事情是：「日日有所学」。只有目标是不够的。

然而，要求自己每日进步对于现在我的生活节奏，有些不现实，压力也过大。

所以，将周期拉长，改成每星期都有所得。

事不过三

  So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you
  what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short,
  we call it a “now page”.

  It's useful for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your
  site: because people on your site want to know more about you.

  Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these
  days?”, those who have a now page say it's a good reminder of their
  priorities. By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps
  you say no to other requests.
