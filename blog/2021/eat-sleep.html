</header><p>
Do you really want to live like an animal?
</p>

<p>
Eat like an animal, sleep like an animal, play like an animal?
</p>

<p>
I don't know about other people, but I certainly don't live like this.
</p>

<p>
I know I'm a human being with memories.
</p>

<p>
I'm curious about everything.
</p>

<p>
I knew somewhere in the world there was something I wanted.
</p>

<p>
The world is not just about eating and sleeping.
</p>

<p>
This is not the life I want.
</p>

<p>
It's stupid and ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
Life is is short, we should do something important.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy your life, make you happy.
</p>

<p>
Listen to your heart, follow your mind.
</p>

<p>
If you did that, You will be very happy.
</p>

<p>
I'm tired of the same old life, so I'm going to make a new one.
</p>

<p>
The world is changing and people are changing.
</p>

<p>
If you want to stay the same, you will pay the price.
</p>

<p>
I love the moon and the sun, I love beautiful landscapes, I love nature
and people
