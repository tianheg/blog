</header><p>
1、赚钱：确保你有一份工作，或者一份咨询工作，或者能带来直接回报的事情。
</p>

<p>
Box 1: Transact
</p>

<p>
The first box in the 8 + 1 system is Transact, and it's about making
money.
</p>

<p>
Transact is just making sure that you have a job, or advisory gigs, or
something that's bringing in a direct revenue stream to support your
life.
</p>

<p>
2、投资，做那些能随着时间产生复利效应的事情。
</p>

<p>
Box 2: Invest
</p>

<p>
The second box is Invest, and it's really about doing things where my
input today compounds over time.
</p>

<p>
3、助益，帮助他人，同时在自己在某些事情上有所助益，并做得更好。
</p>

<p>
Box 3: Assist
</p>

<p>
The third box is Assist, and it's about helping people. It's something I
do anyway, but I want to become better at it. Having it as a bucket
makes sure that I'm purposeful about doing more assisting, and getting
better at it.
</p>

<p>
4、学习，知道自己输出的是什么，然后去学习那些能让自己精进的知识。
</p>

<p>
Box 4: Learn
</p>

<p>
The fourth box is Learn. This box is about being very self-aware of what
my output is, and then figuring out what I need to learn to become
better at providing that output.
</p>

<p>
5、健康，用电脑来打比喻的话，你的身体就是硬件，思维就是软件，无论是身体还是思维出了问题，那一些都免谈了。
</p>

<p>
Box 5: Health
</p>

<p>
The fifth box is Health.
</p>

<p>
To make a computer metaphor: your body is your hardware, and your mind
is your software. So if your body or your mind breaks down everything
else breaks down.
</p>

<p>
6、家庭，明确自己在家庭的中的角色定位，如父亲、丈夫等等，并按照相应的角色去处事。
</p>

<p>
Box 6: Family
</p>

<p>
The sixth box is Family. I have a wife and a kid, and I aspire to be a
good husband and a good father. Having this as an explicit box makes
sure that I'm being purposeful and conscious about achieving those
goals.
</p>

<p>
7、关系，让自己成为一个善于交际的人，定期花时间和你珍视的人建立联系。
</p>

<p>
Box 7: Relationships
</p>

<p>
The seventh box is Relationships.
</p>

<p>
And because of that I've been more of a social butterfly than most
people. And think that's helped me become better at what I do.
</p>

<p>
8、关注自我或者是自我关怀，做那些让自己开心的事，感恩的事，享受的事。
</p>

<p>
Box 8: Ego or Self-Kindness
</p>

<p>
The last box is Ego or Self-Kindness.
</p>

<p>
This box is about doing things for myself, and doing things that make me
happy, and grateful, and creating moments for myself that I enjoy.
</p>

<p>
注重自我关怀
</p>

<p>
+1，每周定期回顾检视，确保执行到位。
</p>

<p>
Plus One
</p>

<p>
The Plus One part of this is setting aside time every single week to go
through each of the boxes and make sure that they're filled up.
</p>
