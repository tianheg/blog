I started my first job as a Professional Programmer on April 21, 2014. I
would like to think that I have graduated from being a junior developer
to being someone intermediate. If I could go back in time and tell
myself what I should be doing, here is what I would say:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Optimize each little thing with your development environment/editor.
Go to your editor's plugin page and look at whatever plugin you can
find. If you can't find a good plugin for what you want to have, then
create one yourself. Whatever editor you use, learn everything about
it.</li>
<li>Optimize your non-development environment (software). This usually
means your browser, and operating system. Browser optimizations:
extensions like Shut Down Facebook News Feed. Operating system
optimizations: Alfred. Some of my optimizations: Spectacle, Caffeine,
Dropbox.</li>
<li>Be good at Where's Waldo. I mean be good at spotting small logic
errors. Things like <code>if file_extension = 'jpg'</code> versus
<code>if file_extension =</code> 'jpg'= drove me crazy. Stupid stuff like editing
the wrong file, not reloading the browser cache so I think what I'm
doing is not working&#x2026;&#x2026;</li>
<li>Optimize your non-development environment (physical environment).
Every little thing should be something that helps you. I like hard
chairs better than soft ones so I code on this crappy $15 chair. I
don't want to prepare coffee when I wake up so I drink one 3-in-1
coffee when I wake up, and then after that I drink the office coffee.</li>
<li>Go outside once in a while. There has to be some kind of actual study
where exercise boosts brain productivity. Run, swim, lift, shoot some
hoops, or do anything. Literally anything physical will work.
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/10936750">I'm personally addicted to
the bike.</a> I try to bike 3 times a week. While biking I've come up
with a too many ideas to mention. In fact, this blog is an idea that
came from the bike.</li>
<li><b>Really think about software development not as a job that you do, but
as a service that you provide for others.</b> Thus you want to provide a
quality of software development that matches your preferred quality
for the people you hire when you do things. You don't hire (and you
certainly won't rehire) a carpenter who sucks, so why would others
hire a developer who also sucks? This is our craft, we should at least
care about it.</li>
</ul>
