<i>People regularly ask me how I get so much done. Here's my secret&#x2026;</i>
</p>

<p>
I get asked about this at least twice a week, so I thought I'd save
myself some time by writing a blog post I can reference instead of
answering the same question repeatedly (spoiler, this is one of my
secrets).
</p>

<p>
To help give you context, here are some of the things I do on a fairly
regular basis these days:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I teach Sunday school to ~6 nine-year-old kids (we're going through
the <a href="https://www.mormon.org/free-bible">Old Testament</a> this year).
In addition to attending 3 hours of church, I also prepare and deliver
a one hour lesson for them every other week.</li>
<li>On Sundays I generally don't commit any code or do any "work." I have
church and family time and responsibilities (though I do enjoy
spending the evening with
<a href="https://twitter.com/craigwalker1123/status/1039138835714560000">new
friends playing Dominion</a>)</li>
<li>On Mondays, I publish the blogpost newsletter from two weeks ago to
<a href="http://kentcdodds.com/blog">kentcdodds.com/blog</a>, a new one for
subscribers. (~1.5 hours of work, depending&#x2026;)</li>
<li>Product tasks (currently helping work on
<a href="https://paypal.me">paypal.me</a>) (this is normally where most of my
weekday is spent)</li>
<li>Attend work meetings</li>
<li>Help people on slack/video chat</li>
<li>Work on
<a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/tools-without-config">paypal-scripts</a>
(among other internal libraries and tools)</li>
<li>traveling/training (about once a quarter. I'm on an airplane right now
for such an engagement)</li>
<li>Research, prepare, and do a <a href="http://kcd.im/devtips">DevTips with Kent
livestream</a> (~20 minutes&#x2026; sometimes) (week-daily)</li>
<li>Respond to literally dozens of GitHub issues/PRs (daily)</li>
<li>Code up or help people code up solutions to the GitHub issues</li>
<li>Release ~5 of any of my &gt;100 npm modules multiple times a day</li>
<li>Travel to (sometimes) and speak at a conference (about once or twice a
month)</li>
<li>Travel to (sometimes) and deliver a 1&#x2013;2 day workshop on one of five
topics I regularly train about.</li>
<li>Record <a href="http://egghead.io/?af=5236ad">egghead.io</a> lessons and
courses (working on some of this very hard core right now)</li>
<li>Research and prepare educational material (for
talks/workshops/courses/devtips/etc.)</li>
<li>Go out to lunch with a (new) friend in the community about once a week</li>
<li>Outline and prepare for writing my novel for
<a href="https://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> (which is going to be epic by the
way).</li>
<li><a href="http://kcd.im/ama">AMA</a>: Ask Me Anything (currently has 475
questions I've answered).</li>
<li><a href="http://kcd.im/tech-chats">TechChats</a>: livestream video chats with
people about tech (about once a month or so).</li>
<li>Publish a 3 minute podcast (on <a href="http://kcd.im/3-mins">3 minutes with
Kent</a>)</li>
<li>Be a guest on podcasts (about once a month or so).</li>
<li>Respond to literally dozens of questions per day coming from Tweets
(mostly), Twitter DMs (several daily), Slack, email, YouTube comments,
and pigeon (one of those is a joke).</li>
</ul>

<p>
On top of all that, I'm married, have 4 kids (6 and younger) and a
puppy, and have a home and yard/garden to care for.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-a-typical-day" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="a-typical-day"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> [[#a-typical-day][]]A typicalÂ day</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-a-typical-day">
<p>
Let me share a fairly general weekday with you:
</p>

<p>
Normally I wake up at ~7:00 AM and I'm ready for work by ~9:00 AM. I sit
at my desk (I work from home) and start with my daily scripture study
for a few minutes. Then I power on the computer, and start with my email
and twitter (the stuff I hadn't addressed while brushing my teeth etc.
ðŸ˜…). If I'm aware of any pressing work, I'll take care of that first. If
it's Monday, I'll make sure my blog post is published, then start
working on this week's blogpost newsletter. Then I do the DevTips with
Kent livestream.
</p>

<p>
By this time it's normally ~10:00 AM (or later on Mondays/if there's
pressing work I had to do first). It's likely that I've already released
one or two new versions of my npm modules, answered a half dozen
questions, and responded/reviewed several GitHub issues/PRs. Now I start
on whatever PayPal product work I'm working on (as I mentioned, I'm
helping with <a href="https://paypal.me">paypal.me</a> right now). I meet with my
co-workers and decide the highest priority tasks and get to work on
them.
</p>

<p>
At ~12:00 PM (often later if I'm really involved in something), I go up
and have lunch with my family. If he's not already in bed, I read a book
to one of my boys and put him down for a nap (working from home is the
best). My lunch break is normally ~30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
I spend the afternoon working on more PayPal stuff, meetings, helping
answer questions from all the various channels (and sadly ignoring many
of them as I have work to do), and releasing more versions of various
OSS libraries/tools.
</p>

<p>
I wrap up the day between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM and head upstairs. It's
family time. Often I'll hang out with my wife after the kids are in bed.
Sometimes though, if I'm working on a big course for
<a href="http://egghead.io/?af=5236ad">egghead.io</a> or something, I'll go back
to my office and start working on that. Normally I'll go to bed before
11:00 PM.
</p>

<p>
Saturdays are mostly yard work and family time. I don't <i>normally</i> do
much coding on Saturdays. Sundays are family and church time. I very
rarely do any work on Sundays (occasionally I'll merge simple PRs from
my phone or get a head start on this newsletter).
</p>

<p>
If this schedule sounds set in stone or a solid routine, let me assure
you it's not. What I've written is a pretty general schedule that wasn't
really planned and is just what kinda happened. In any case, I hope it
helps to frame the rest of my advice in a way that's relatable and
helpful to you.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-its-an-illusion" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="its-an-illusion"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> [[#its-an-illusion][]]It's anÂ illusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-its-an-illusion">
<p>
If you read carefully, you'll notice that I do a bunch of my stuff when
I'm on the clock at PayPal. That's because the stuff I do is good for
PayPal and my bosses have appreciated that I do it. Just last week I had
multiple different engineers within PayPal thank me for the daily
<a href="http://kcd.im/devtips">DevTips with Kent</a> livestreams and
<a href="http://kcd.im/news">these newsletters</a>. PayPal is happy that I'm
sharing my knowledge and so long as what I share is not
proprietary/legally concerning/etc, they're happy to let me continue
doing that. (You could say this newsletter is sponsored by PayPal!
Thanks PayPal!).
</p>

<p>
PayPal employees also use a bunch of the open source software that I
maintain. So when I'm doing work on my open source projects during work
hours, 90% of the time it's because we have a problem within PayPal that
needs solving and I'm just doing my job to make PayPal engineers more
effective. Some of my projects are libraries that I created at PayPal
and then open sourced while others are projects I created outside of my
time at PayPal and now PayPal engineers use. In either case, working on
those projects (and contributing to other projects of which I'm not a
maintainer), is all part of my job.
</p>

<p>
So when people ask me: "HOW DO YOU DO ALL THIS STUFF <i>AND</i> HAVE A JOB AT
PAYPAL!?" My answer is: "well&#x2026; a lot of this stuff <i>is</i> my job at
PayPal."
</p>

<p>
This brings me to my next point:
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org44741f7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org44741f7"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> [[#increase-the-impact-of-your-value][]]Increase the impact of</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
yourÂ value
</p>
<p>
:CUSTOM<sub>ID</sub>: increase-the-impact-of-your-value
</p>
<p>
We're all constantly creating value in the world. A conversation with
your co-worker over lunch about why, what, and how to do a git rebase is
creating value. A meetup talk you're delivering is creating value. etc.
etc. etc. The secret that I've found is taking the value that you're
already creating, and increase its impact by preserving and presenting
it to the world.
</p>

<p>
So turn that conversation into a blog post or have that conversation
over Google Hangouts on Air and have it upload to YouTube automatically
(which is what my <a href="http://kcd.im/tech-chats">tech chats</a> are). Make
sure your meetup talk is recorded (even if that means you're just
recording your screen, which I do all the time). Instead of answering
your co-worker's slack question about arrow functions on slack, type it
out as a quick blog post on medium, a gist, or a ðŸ”¥ FIRE ðŸ”¥ TWEET ðŸ”¥ and
send them the link.
</p>

<p>
As long as your company is cool with you sharing non-proprietary
knowledge with the world, then take advantage of that (as a side note, I
would have a very hard time being successful at a company which does not
value open knowledge sharing like this. I know it's a privilege to work
at a company like PayPal. Sorry if you're not in an environment like
PayPal in this way.)
</p>

<p>
In short <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579">learn in
public</a> (I love you <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx">Shawn!</a>). It's likely
that if you listed out all the things you do in a week your list would
be just as long if not longer than mine. The thing that makes it appear
that I am so productive is that I make public as much of what I do as
possible.

<div id="outline-container-automation" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="automation"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> [[#automation][]]Automation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-automation">
<p>
If you maintain an npm package, it may surprise you (or you may be
skeptical of the fact) that I manage to release multiple versions of
multiple packages in a typical day. Believe me though, I release almost
every PR made on my open source projects within minutes of my merging
them into <code>master</code>, and often I do so from my phone.
</p>

<p>
This is possible because my open source projects have a solid suite of
tests that run in CI and give me confidence things are working followed
by an automation script that publishes to npm and generates a GitHub
changelog. For years I've been using an awesome tool called
<a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release">semantic-release</a>
(shoutout to
<a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/README.md#team">the
team of fantastic humans</a>) to automatically release my packages.
</p>

<p>
The concept of automation is something
<a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/automation">I've written about in the
past</a>. It's how I got into software development and I feel strongly
that automation is the way we can make ourselves more productive (
<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205">even if it takes longer to develop the
automation than the time it would save us</a>). If you find yourself
repeatedly doing a task, see if there's a simple way to automate it.
(Like <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/hive-api">what I do for creating
my kcd.im/ short urls</a> +
<a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/dotfiles/blob/94c00b43354f86595647f9ff18057ff9e6469d33/.bash_profile#L61-L63">shorten</a>
ðŸ˜„, which happens to be another form of automation and productivity boost
because short URLs are easier/faster to give to people, and people
remember them better).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-enable-others">
<p>
Many of those releases of my open source projects I do are releasing
code that I did not write. I put forth an investment of time in helping
<a href="http://kcd.im/pull-request">and teaching</a> other people contribute to
my projects and
<a href="https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors">do things</a> to
help motivate people to do so. This means that I'm able to do more
because other people handle a lot of project maintenance for me so I can
do other things.

<h2 id="org84e4543"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> [[#dont-answer-the-same-question-twice][]]Don't answer the same</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
questionÂ twice
</p>
<p>
:CUSTOM<sub>ID</sub>: dont-answer-the-same-question-twice
</p>
<p>
I learned early on that people ask me repeat questions early on. I like
to give them answers, but I also found out quickly that
<a href="http://kcd.im/no-time">I don't have time to answer everyone</a> and it's
a bit frustrating to answer the same question multiple times. This is
why having <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog">an active blog</a> and
<a href="http://kcd.im/ama">an AMA</a> are super helpful.
</p>

<p>
If someone asks me a question, 99% of the time I'll ask them to ask it
on my AMA. If I get the same question many times, then I'll make it the
subject of a DevTip or blog. Having multiple places/formats I can go to
answer people's questions in public does four things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Allows me to answer their question</li>
<li>Allows others to see that answer (increases the impact of the value
I'm creating)</li>
<li>Gives me motivation to give them a higher quality answer.</li>
<li>Gives me a link to share with the next person who asks (which is way
faster than writing it out again)</li>
</ol>

<p>
I guess it also contributes to the illusion that I'm doing more and I'm
more productive. I'm sure you answer a lot of questions as well, but how
does anyone know if you don't share?

<h2 id="avoiding-burnout"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> [[#avoiding-burnout][]]Avoiding Burnout</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-avoiding-burnout">
<p>
When I tweeted that this would be the subject of today's newsletter, my
good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/markdalgleish">Mark Dalgleish</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/1038922626826031104">responded</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Because you haven't burned out yet?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I honestly don't think that I've ever truly burned out. I've only been
doing this software thing professionally for ~4 years, so maybe that's
why. I've definitely burned out on specific projects or frameworks, but
I've generally been able to keep moving and doing things that keep me
excited and provide value to the world while taking care of myself and
my relationships.
</p>

<p>
I should probably do this subject better justice in another blog post,
but I'll just say that in general what I do to avoid burnout is to not
do stuff I don't have to do or want to do. I've learned and internalized
that I don't owe anyone anything unless I've made an actual commitment
of marriage/employment/etc. So while I try to be kind and helpful, at
the end of the day if I can't help, then I don't and I don't stress over
it.
</p>

<p>
For example, there are many open issues on my GitHub projects that get
no response from me because I've chosen to give my time to other things
I'd rather do. I do feel bad I can't do more, but I don't stress over
it.
</p>

<p>
This subject isn't all that simple, but that's all I have time for (and
I'm not going to stress over not giving you more because I don't owe you
anything ðŸ˜œ #seewhatididthere).

<div id="outline-container-hyper-focused" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="hyper-focused"><span class="section-number-2">8</span> [[#hyper-focused][]]Hyper-focused</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-hyper-focused">
<p>
I've listed pretty much everything I do. You may have noticed that I
don't have many hobbies. This is true. I have a few things that I do for
fun, but it pretty much all boils down to: Family, Religion, and Coding.
</p>

<p>
Even though this is working out so far, I don't believe this is
sustainable. This is one reason why I'm so excited about writing this
novel for <a href="https://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>. It'll be a new creative
outlet. And hopefully by November I'll be done with most of
<a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1038584983990849536">the HUGE
things I'm working</a> on so I can dedicate myself to writing 50,000 words
in 30 daysÂ :)
</p>

<p>
That said, I think short bursts of hyper-focus do help me get a lot
done. Whether I'm hyper-focused on an
<a href="http://egghead.io/?af=5236ad">egghead.io</a> course, or getting
something specific done at work, it helps me get things done. I'm not
sure how to explain it, but for me hyper-focus means that I kinda don't
think about anything else for a while. When I'm not with my family or
fulfilling another commitment, I'm thinking about and working on this
thing until it's done.
</p>

<p>
I didn't explain that well and should probably remove this section, but
I'm not gonna. Maybe it'll be helpful for someone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Continued:</b> Turns out this was helpful to a few people so I thought I'd
expound on this a tiny bit (and my wife suggested that I do as well
because she thinks this makes a significant impact on who I am (not
necessarily that it's a desirable trait).
</p>

<p>
So this necessarily isn't a short-term kind of thing, it doesn't prevent
me from sleeping well at night (though sometimes I do have trouble
shutting my brain off, most of the time I sleep fine). This also isn't
the same as staying focused and on-task during a period of several hours
when I'm trying to get something done (something that I'm typically not
very good at doing unless I'm <i>very</i> excited about it).
</p>

<p>
This hyper-focus is pretty much that I immerse myself in the subject for
a period of time. As an example, since I decided that I want to write
this novel a few weeks ago, I've found a TON of content online about
tools novel writers use to make their books "work" and I've been
consuming it at a rapid rate. It's filled my idle mind. I'm still able
to turn my attention to my family, my work, or courses that I'm working
on, but when I'm doing mundane tasks and my brain is able to think
freely, it's consumed by the idea of the novel itself and learning tools
that I can apply when I start writing it in November. Ask my wife. If
we're not talking about something that's actually important, then I'll
inevitably turn the conversation over to the book (and she's been
<a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1043712163490160640">extremely
helpful</a>).
</p>

<p>
I don't have tips of how you can develop this in yourself, and I'm not
even sure that I would recommend it. It's just something that I do that
my wife and I think may have something to do with my productivity.

I do not spend a lot of time watching other people's courses or reading
other people's blogs/newsletters. I definitely will skim blog posts as
needed, or I'll sit down and watch a few
<a href="http://egghead.io/?af=5236ad">egghead.io</a> lessons or part of a
Frontend Master's course when there's something specific I need to
learn. I love <a href="https://gedd.ski">Dave Geddes's</a> mastery games on
<a href="https://www.gridcritters.com">CSS grid</a> and
<a href="https://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies">Flexbox</a>, but generally
I spend a bunch more time working on producing my own material/projects.
I think that makes me more productive as well.

<p>
With all this talk of productivity, I should probably mention that I've
learned that it's important to live a balanced life. Like I said, I can
get pretty focused on one thing, but I spend a lot of time with my
family and that brings me joy. Shutting down for a little bit, taking a
step back, and <b>working on your relationships</b> is where you'll get your
juice to keep going.
</p>

<p>
So <b>the fact that I'm married and have four kids and a dog isn't a
detriment to my productivity,</b> but really <i>it's an important part of my

<li>I learn in public, thereby increasing the impact of the value that I
create.</li>
<li>I automate mundane/time consuming/context switching tasks</li>
<li>I answer questions in a public forum</li>
<li>I spend more time producing than consuming</li>
</ul>

I should say also that my wife plays a <b>huge</b> role in how I'm so
productive. However, she is a pretty private person and asked that I not
talk about her much publicly (except she did give me permission to say
this). I couldn't do all of the things I do if it weren't for her.

I don't want to give the false impression that I only <i>appear</i>
productive either. I really do feel like I'm quite productive. But
hopefully this makes my productivity more realistic and attainable in
your mind. I hope some of these ideas help inspire you to be more
productive and more importantly find more happiness through your
relationships. Good luck!
