<blockquote>
<p>
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are
chiefly these three:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all
complex ideas are made.</li>
<li>The second is bring two ideas, whether simple or complex, together,
and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once,
without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of
relations.</li>
<li>The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them
in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its
general ideas are made.</li>
</ol>
