<p>
If there's a golden rule, it's this one, so I put it first. All the
other rules are more or less elaborations of this rule #1.
</p>

<p>
You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people
"learn in private", and lurk. They consume content without creating any
themselves. Again, that's fine, but we're here to talk about being in
the top quintile. What you do here is to have <b>a habit of creating
learning exhaust</b>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets.</li>
<li>Speak at meetups and conferences.</li>
<li>Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. <b>Avoid</b> the walled
gardens like Slack and Discord, they're not public.</li>
<li>Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams.</li>
<li>Start a newsletter.</li>
<li>Draw cartoons (<a href="https://code-cartoons.com/">people</a>
<a href="https://wizardzines.com/">loooove</a>
<a href="https://arkwright.github.io/scaling-react-server-side-rendering.html">cartoons</a>!).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whatever your thing is, <b>make the thing you wish you had found</b> when you
were learning. <b>Don't judge</b> your results by "claps" or retweets or
stars or upvotes - just talk to yourself from 3 months ago. I keep an
almost-daily dev blog written for no one else but me.
</p>

<p>
Guess what? It's not about reaching as many people as possible with your
content. If you can do that, great, remember me when you're famous. But
chances are that <i>by far</i> the biggest beneficiary of you trying to help
past you is <i>future you</i>. If others benefit, that's icing.
</p>

<p>
Oh you think you're done? Don't stop there:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Enjoyed a coding video? Reach out to the speaker/instructor and thank
them, and ask questions.</li>
<li>Make PR's to libraries you use.</li>
<li>Make your own libraries no one will ever use.</li>
<li><b>Clone stuff you like, from scratch, to see how they work</b>.</li>
<li>Teach workshops.</li>
<li>Go to conferences and summarize what you learned.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you're tired of creating one-off things, start building a persistent
knowledge base that grows over time.
<a href="https://www.swyx.io/speaking/open-source-knowledge/">Open Source your
Knowledge</a>! At every step of the way: <i>Document what you did and the
problems you solved.</i>
</p>

<p>
The subheading under this rule would be: <b>Try your best to be right, but
don't worry when you're wrong.</b> Repeatedly. If you feel uncomfortable,
or like an impostor, good. You're pushing yourself. Don't assume you
know everything, but try your best anyway, and let the internet correct
you when you are inevitably wrong. Wear your noobyness on your sleeve.
</p>

<p>
<b>People think you suck?</b> Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in
detail, why you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to <b>be</b>
good? No objections, no hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them
wrong. Of course, if they get abusive block them.
</p>

<p>
Did I mention that teaching is the best way to learn? <b>Talk while you
code</b>. It can be stressful and I haven't done it all that much but my
best technical interviews have been where I ended up talking like I
teach instead of desperately trying to prove myself. We're animals,
we're attracted to confidence and can smell desperation.
</p>

<p>
At some point you'll get some support behind you. People notice genuine
learners. They'll want to help you. Don't tell them, but they just
became your mentors. *This is very important:
<a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public-hack">Pick up what they
put down</a>*. Think of them as offering up quests for you to complete.
When they say "Anyone willing to help with <b>__</b> <b>__</b>?" you're that kid
in the first row with your hand already raised. These are senior
engineers, some of the most in-demand people in tech. They'll spend time
with you, 1 on 1, if you help them out (p.s. and there's always
something they want help on). You can't pay for this stuff. They'll
teach you for free. Most people don't see what's right in front of them.
But not you.
</p>

<p>
"With so many junior devs out there, why will they help <i>me</i>?", you ask.
</p>

<p>
<b>Because you learn in public.</b> By teaching you, they teach many. You
amplify them. You have one thing they don't: a beginner's mind. You see
how this works?
</p>

<p>
At some point people will start asking you for help because of all the
stuff you put out. 80% of developers are "dark", they dont write or
speak or participate in public tech discourse. But you do. You must be
an expert, right? Don't tell them you aren't. Answer best as you can,
and when you're stuck or wrong pass it up to your mentors.
</p>

<p>
Eventually you run out of mentors, and just solve things on your own.
You're still putting out content though. You see how this works?
</p>

<p>
Learn in public.
</p>

<p>
p.s. Eventually, they'll want to pay you for your help too. A lot more
than you think.

Learn in public, fanatically. Find something you can't stop thinking
about and know it better than anyone, and share everything you learn
along the way. Once deep enough, start building something too. Make
something you have to sell as early as possible. -

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
In some places, Knowledge Management is about creating systems that
get around people's knowledge deficiencies. At Goddard, it really
seems like it is about empowering people to share and reflect on what
they know best. It's a subtle distinction, but I really like that they
put people in the center of this work, and start from a place of
abundant knowledge in people rather than a lack of information in
systems. Social media has a lot of potential, but you need to think
about how to facilitate different kinds of (online and offline)
relationships between people so that their thinking is improved,
innovation occurs, they can get quick answers to complex problems, in
order to enhance and accelerate business outcomes. One of the great
benefits of using social media as a KM tool is that you are creating
and capturing the knowledge at the same time. However, in order for
this to truly work people have to be willing to collaborate in the
open throughout the project lifecycle. "Learning in Public" is scary
for many reasons &#x2013; people can find and cling to outdated information
and users are exposing their knowledge during a vulnerable time in the
project (i.e. when they don't yet have all the answers). However,
during this part of the process is when learning can be most valuable.
If you share what you know and what you don't know in the middle of a
project, you give people an opportunity to share specific knowledge
that can help you in the moment. If it works, this can help save time
and money.

Back in 2007 Chris Coyier launched a site called css-tricks.com. It
was a site dedi- cated to teaching people how to code websites. (CSS
is the language that describes how websites should look.) When
CSS-Tricks first came out I remember reading a tutorial and arrogantly
thinking, "I know that already." Chris and I were at about the same
skill level, so I didn't learn anything new from him. This continued
for a while as he kept putting out new tutorials. But over time, as
friends started asking me CSS questions, I found it easier to link to
one of Chris's articles (since they were really well written) than
explain everything myself. Years later Chris ran a Kickstarter
campaign to redesign his site. Those who con- tributed would get
behind-the-scenes access to additional tutorials and content re- lated
to the redesign. The goal was set fairly low at $3,500. He quickly
blew past the goal and by the end of the campaign had raised $89,697.
Incredible. The point is that he did it with relative ease, all
because he had built up an audi- ence who loved his work. *He and I
started at the same point and our skills progressed at about the same
rate. The difference was that he taught and shared, whereas I kept
what I was learning to myself. That made the difference between being
able to make tens of thousands of dollars on a new project versus
releasing to no one.*
