  <h1>Tone.js demo</h1>

  <p>Tone.js is a Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser. The architecture of Tone.js aims to
    be familiar to both musicians and audio programmers creating web-based audio applications. On the high-level, Tone
    offers common DAW (digital audio workstation) features like a global transport for synchronizing and scheduling
    events as well as prebuilt synths and effects. Additionally, Tone provides high-performance building blocks to
    create your own synthesizers, effects, and complex control signals.</p>
